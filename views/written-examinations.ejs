        <p class="heading"><strong>What is NDA?</strong></p>

        <p class="p1">
            The National Defence Academy (NDA) is the Joint Services academy of the Indian Armed Forces, where cadets of
            the three services, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force train together before they go on to
            pre-commissioning training in their respective service academies. The NDA is located in Khadakwasla near
            Pune, Maharashtra. It is the first tri-service academy in the world.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            NDA alumni have led and fought in every major conflict in which the Indian Armed Forces has been called to
            action since the academy was established. The alumni include 3 Param Vir Chakra recipients and 9 Ashoka
            Chakra recipients.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
            NDA or National Defence Academy is a national institute for training selected young men for officer level
            entry into the Armed forces of India. NDA is located at Khadakwasla near Pune, Maharashtra. It is a training
            facility for the leaders of tomorrow who will be respected and followed. It is not just an institution but a
            way of living. NDA transforms a hesitant young cadet into an honourable, physically and mentally competent
            and polished man who is prepared for any kind of adversity that might face him; an officer and a gentleman.
        </p>
        <p class="p4">
            The training at NDA is rigorous. In addition to service training for the Army, Navy and Air Force, the
            cadets are also taught academics to cover the graduation level degree in Arts, Sciences or Computers. The
            training at NDA is broken into six terms and the total duration of training is three years. Once their
            training is concluded, the cadets are awarded their bachelorâ€™s degree at the passing out parade of NDA.
            Thereafter the cadets go to their respective service institutes i.e. the Indian Military Academy or IMA for
            army cadets, Air Force Academy Hyderabad for Air force cadets and Naval Academy Cochin for Naval Cadets.
